# RSA
This repository hosts a Python script that demonstrates the implementation of RSA encryption and decryption alongside basic mathematical functions critical to understanding cryptography. The script encapsulates both the generation of RSA keys and the cryptographic processes of encrypting and decrypting messages.

Features
Mathematical Foundations: Implements functions to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are essential for generating RSA keys.
Prime Number Generation: Includes a method to generate random prime numbers using the sympy.isprime function, ensuring the robustness of RSA keys.
RSA Key Generation: Automatically generates a pair of public and private keys for RSA encryption, ensuring the keys are suitable for encryption tasks.
Encryption and Decryption: Allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the generated RSA keys, showcasing the practical application of RSA algorithms.
